# Project Proposal
--- 
### The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
- The main idea for our project is to create a note taking application that will also allow users to code (which the program will automatically format the code in the way that it would have appeared on VS Code). We believe that this will be a helpful device for many students who are learning to code, as it will allow them to comment and take notes on the code in a clean and visually appealing way (easy for review).
- A minimum viable product would be a notebook with only Python language for the code formatting.
- A stretch goal would be a notebook with multiple languages, such as Python, JavaScript, R, and HTML.

### Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
- Since both Mason and I are still very new to coding, we believe that we will learn a lot more about professional coding and how to keep our code clean and organized. Furthermore, by working with a partner, this will allow us to experience the real world scenario of how to collaborate with other developers. This project will offer both soft skills (collaboration, communication, etc.) and hard skills (coding logics, writing function, etc.). 

### Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
- Professor Zhi has recently suggested about Notion API, so we will be looking at how the API works and find how we can integrate it into our program. 
- We will also be looking at Graphic User Interface (GUI) when designing our application interface. The standard GUI library for Python is called Tkinter, so we will take a look more into how the library works. 
- We will also need to design the backend of the application. This will include creating a database to store notes. For database, it makes the most sense to use sqldatabase and mysql  libraries to connect to the database. We are planning on the CRUD operation framework to maintain applications.

### Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.
- Weeks 1-2: Come up with an outline and plan for our project. By the end of week 2 we should have at least an outline of all the features we want, the exact design of the project, and the platform that we want it to be used through.
- Weeks 3-5: Come up with pseudo-code for our project. Want to have a solid english translation of how each aspect of the code will work, and how all these aspects will work together to create our final project. 
- Weeks 5-8: Writing of actual code. We want sufficient time to be able to work through all of the kinks and come up with a final product we are happy with.
- NOTE: Week 5 overlaps because ideally we would want pseudo-code to be written quicker to give us more time to work out the actual code. Ideally we will leave the most weeks to be able to write the code and consult with the professor. 

### Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
- To begin, we will try and split up the work when it comes to the simpler tasks. Because we are in different time zones we will try and meet once or twice a week to talk through what we are woking on and collaborate. 
- As the project progresses, we will definitely run into issues that would be easier to solve with two brains as opposed to one. So as we get into the actual coding, the individual work will become less and we may try to code together to bounce ideas off of eachother
- I think the overall model of our collaboration plan will be flexibility, especially because we are on opposite sides of the planet. Week by week we will figure out if it makes more sense to split things up or do things individually and then meet about it
  
### Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
- The biggest challenge to our project is definitely going to be the time zone difference. Prim’s daytime is my nighttime so we will have to plan accordingly so we can collaborate properly and create a satisfying final product. I think we have handled it pretty well so far though, and if it means a couple late nights for me or for her I think that is completely doable. 

### Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
- We’re not entirely sure of exactly which content would be, but so far we know for sure that all of the foundational content (loops, condition statement and iteration). Also, the design interface case would definitely be helpful with how we will be building the interface for our application.
